      Hadera is a city in the Haifa District of Israel in the northern Sharon,
      which is located on the Mediterranean coast. It was established as a
      colony by the first aliyah in 1891, and was declared a city in 1952.
      Hadera, an old coastal city, has undergone a massive momentum of activity
      and development in recent years, which is reflected in every corner of the
      city. Hadera has a unique structure, thanks to which its residents enjoy a
      quality of life. The city is spread over a huge area of about 53,000
      dunams and its neighborhoods are far from the city center and from each
      other. Between the neighborhoods and around them are nature sites and
      ornamental and hiking corners, which attract hikers both from Hadera and
      outside it.
